Moving image, moving painting
theory is practice, seeing hstorical work gives you authority to talk about your own work

KREISE
ein farbenspiel von oscar fischinger
visual music, absolute film
abstraction wasnt as common in the early 20th century
pushed narrative aside, make room for motion, shapes, colours, search of the absolute
relationship between image and sound is explored

film as modernist art
loads of different movements in different countries and things

modernism film is not to be confused with hollywood cinema

charlie chapln modern times
modernist concepts like man vs machine

fischinger more poetic

jacques tati playtime

commercial film dealt with fictional realism, like painting
as painting moved on to cubism and shit so did film and music

film was attractive to move on the avant garde

paul klee
came from a musical background, had influence on fischinger

viking eggling, hans richter, walther ruttman 

viking eggling diagonal symphony

walther ruttman, lichtspiel opus 1, 1921

NOT unobjective art, fischinger preferred absolute film
absolute: fundamental opposition to the realistic, reprodicttive cinema, rather look at spiritual world

though th went away from photo realistic represantatin, but were still interested in physics, biology, speed, human gesture

human movement rather than mechanical movement
