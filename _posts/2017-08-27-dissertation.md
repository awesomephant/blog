intro: "The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical artifacts: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, New Typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The philosophical and political struggle that led to these outcomes seems distant to us. Reading some of the manifestos published at the Bauhaus, written in somewhat stilted 1920s German can only give us a faint idea of the monumental endeavour the Bauhausler were engaged in."

Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, overlooking Dessau from their glass-wrapped studios this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was driven by the search for individual expression. Johannes Itten, with his head shaved and wearing a robe of his own design taught the now-famous Vorkurs: Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic exercises. The Sommerfeld House in Berlin with its excentric, hand-crafted decoration is an often-cited example for the expresionism of the early Bauhaus (Bauhaus100.de, 2017).

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more collective outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would come to define the "Bauhaus Style". The following year Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus. It was during this later period that Marcel Breuer produced furniture out of precision steel tube (then a cutting-edge material), Marianne Brandt designed household items for mass-production and Gropius himself completed some of the most iconic examples of modernist architecture (Droste, 1998).

Despite its academic success the Bauhaus was faced with political pressure from its inception. The increasingly right-wing government of Weimar forced the Bauhaus to move to Dessau. However, the rise of the Nazis on a national level brought the end of the Bauhaus. After a brief period in Berlin under the leadership of Mies van der Rohe, the remaining Bauhausler agreed to disband in 1933. Many were forced to flee Germany, which of course only served to spread Bauhaus ideas. Gropius, Breuer, Mies and others continued to teach in the United States, contributing to the emergence of the "International Style". (Wilder, 2016)

The architectural legacy of this period surrounds us to this day. I'm writing this from a 1960s university building with steel windows, concrete slab floors and curtain walls not dissimilar to what Gropius used 40 years prior in Dessau. Similar buildings can be found in cities all over the world. 

While there are many beautiful examples of post-war modernism (The Seagram Building by Mies van der Rohe comes to mind), many of us are more familiar with what a recent New York Times article describes as "cheap, boxlike concrete-slab high-rises that spread like bacteria [...] after World War II" (Wilder, 2016). Social housing especially is a common object of criticism. For instance, Tom Wolfe argues that post-war modernist architecture is an overly intellectual European import which fails to account for the needs of "real people". He cites the widely publicized demolition of the Pruitt–Igoe housing estate in St. Louis in 1972 (only 20 years after its construction) as evidence for the failure of modernist principles. (Wolfe, 1981)

I'm laying out this background to explain the confilct I'm trying to reconcile. On one hand, there is the utopian vision of the Bauhausler: A world in which housing, transportation, appliances, culture and food is designed through a scientific process and mass-produced by machines as to be affordable to everyone. By reducing forms to their functional minimum, the Bauhaus aimed to create universal solutions for housing, education and everyday life. On the other hand, there is the ubiquitous image of the derelict modernist housing block, which seems to suggest that there is in fact no such thing as a universal solution.

So the question I'm trying to answer is this: How does the modernist notion of rational, universal solutions to problems of everyday life hold up when faced with inherently individualistic everyday people? Were the Bauhausler aware of this conflict, and were trying to reconcile it? Can we see physical evidence of the conflict in the built environment, and has its manifestation changed over time? The last question seems especially relevant today, close to the 2019 Bauhaus centenary: Like in the beginning of the 20th century, we're again in the middle of a fundamental economic shift. Where in Gropius' day growing industrial production created the needs for new forms of living, longer life expectancy and automated production are challenging our notions of work and living today.

To answer these questions, we must return to the physical artifiacts of the historical Bauhaus. Careful examination of these artifacts and how they have fared over the last 100 years might allow us to draw conclusions on the larger ideological concepts they manifest. 

There is a wide range of physical artifacts we might chose look at: Bauhaus students were engaged in weaving, interior decoration, furniture-making as well as painting, graphic design and advertising, and many well-known products of these activities survive in archives, exhibitions and museum shops around the world.

We might, for instance, look at Marcel Breyer's steel tube chairs: One fo the first iterations, known as "B3" was designed in 1925 following what might be called early ergonomic guidelines, recommending "angled position of the upper body" and "elastic seat and back rests" (Breuer, 1925). Early models were built in collaboration with local steel manufacturers from a cutting-edge material of the day: precision steel tube. In marketing material released in 1927 Breuer uses both the functionalist design approach and the use of industrial materials as primary selling points (Breuer, 1927). It is unclear to what extent Breuer is post-rationalising here - In a later interview he describes how he was inspired by the handlebars of a friend's bicycle, which suggests a more formalist origin of the B3 chair (Knoll.com, 2017).

The B3 also illustrates an issue shared by many Bauhaus designs. While the work was underpinned by strong progressive ideas and intended to serve the working class, this rarely came to fruition. The B3 was picked up by a manufacturer (Standard Mobel, Berlin), but production still required a great deal of manual labour and the material, although "durable and easy to clean" remained expensive. This disparity between Breuer's rethoric and the physical result shows the two competing interests him and other Bauhausler were trying to reconcile: On one side, they were trying to design models that could be cheaply mass-produced and improve the lives of regular people. But they were also eager to use new materials and forms even if this made their designs more expensive to produce and less practical in the short-term. These were political gestures, suggestions of a potential future as well as "rational" responses to present-day problems.

However of all the disciplines taught at the Bauhaus, one stands out above all the others: "The ultimate goal of all art" at the Bauhaus, as Gropius declares in the 1919 manifesto, is architecture. Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1930, and countless more after the school disbanded (Engels, 2001). This count includes buildings that were built by Gropius and others relatively independently from the Bauhaus, but some were the result of the type of cross-discipline collaboration that was at the core of the Bauhaus idea. These large-scale projects addressed real-world issues while at the same time serving as cross-discipline classroom experiments at the Bauhaus.

## Architecture at the Bauhaus
Architecture was at the centre of Bauhaus thinking from the very beginning. In the manifesto, Gropius lays out his hope for the "new building", which would unite all artistic disciplines:

> So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come.' (Gropius, 1919)

It is worth pointing out how Gropius is invoking medieaval imagery to talk about the future. The concept of craft guilds, which Gropius refers to in the opening sentence dates back to the 13th century. Further, the "building [...] that will unite every discipline [...] and which will rise heavenwards" is a clear reference to the medieaval cathedral. This is further emphasised by Lionel Feininger's "Cathedral" Woodcut used to illustrate the text (Burshart, 2009).  This turning back to medieaval concepts continues in the way teaching was organised at the Bauhaus: Rather than professors and students, Bauhausler were referred to as "masters" and "apprentices", with teaching taking palce primarily in the workshops. This positions Gropius' ideas, and indeed some of the early products of the Bauhaus (such as the Sommerfeld House) surprisingly close to those of the Arts and Crafts movement. 

Despite his strong emphasis on building, it took Gropius three years to establish a formal architecture department. Up to that point he had arranged for students to take classes at a traditional technical school in Weimar (Droste, 1999). 

![Large Scale Building Blocks](/assets/unit-9/baukasten-im-grossen.jpg)
**Figure 0.1:** Illustration showing the concept of Gropius' "Large-Scale Building Blocks", published in Bauhausbuch 3: Ein Versuchshaus des Bauhauses in Weimar, 1925. Unknown artsit, Walter Gropius.

This was reinforced from 1928, when Swiss architect Hannes Meyer took over the post of director from Walter Gropius. While Gropius argued that the artist should be part of the building process along with other experts, Meyer demands rigorous functionalism. In a 1926 article he declares: 

> Building is a biological process. Building is not an aesthetic process. Reduced to its elements, the new dwelling will be not just a machine for living, but a biological device to fulfill psychological and physical needs (Meyer 1926, Page 4)

In the same publication he lists the "schedules of people inside and outside the house, physical aspects of the building site, sunlight, acoustics and psychology" as datapoints that sohuld be used to inform architectural decisions. His architectural drawings are filled with tables and graphs describing the results of soil analysis, sunlight calculations and weather observations at the building site. Under the brief tenure of Mies van der Rohe from 1930 to 1933 the understanding of architecture at the Bauhaus shifted away from the strict functionalism of Hannes Meyer toward a more aesthetically-driven exploration of space.

A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (1920, destroyed 1945), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). However, it is the more obscure examples of Bauhaus architecture 

However, many more have escaped public attention for most of their existence. They were never regarded as architectural monuments, but used by the public like any other building - Many of them didn't receive heritage protection until very recently. As such they were altered, extended, worn down and painted over with little hesitation. We could lament this loss of architectural history (and people do), but in our search for evidence as to the success (or failure) of modernism, we couldn't get luckier. Here we have the physical manifestations of 1920s modernist ideals, tested mercilessly by regular people through decades of war, reconstruction and changing political regimes up to the present day. 


## The Dessau-Torten Estate

![Dessau Torten Aereal Photograph](/assets/unit-9/torten-aereal.jpg)
**Figure 1:** Aereal photograph of the Dessau Torten settlement today

The example I will be primarily discussing here is the housing estate Dessau-Torten. Designed by Walter Gropius and members of the Bauhaus, it consits of 314 single-family, two-story houses across roughly six square miles. The initial construction was completed in three phases from 1926 to 1928, with later expansions added by Hannes Meyer and Richard Paulick. (Schwarting, 2012)

The Dessau Torten settlement takes a unique position in the physical legacy of the Bauhaus.   

After a planned housing project in Weimar had failed to materialise (only one building, the Haus am Horn, was ever completed), Torten was the first opportunity for Gropius to put the ideas he had developed during the early 1920s to practice on a large scale. Indeed, the prospect of building Torten may have been a major motivation for Gropius to move the Bauhaus to Dessau in the first place. This move was part of a concerted effort by the social-democratic government of Dessau to address a housing shortage caused by a rapid growth in population following a period of industrial growth.

Torten was part of a national effort to provide affordable housing to lower-income families. Individual units in Torten were sold for between RM 9.500 and RM 10.100, or around RM30 per month - well within the reach of an average industrial worker (Gropius, 1930). The fact that units were sold off individually is ciritcal in our analysis of Torten over time. Individual ownership meant that units could be altered individually with few restrictions, making Torten an ideal case for analysis. 

Torten received heritage protection in 1994, which limits the extent of structural changes home-owners have been allowed to make since. A number of buildings have been bought by the local government and restored to their original state. (Schwarting, Matz 2012)

## Initial Construction

While the Dessau government was looking for a pragmatic solution to a housing shortage, Gropius saw an opportunity to test ideas on archiectural language, construction technology and organisation on a large scale. The experimental natue of Torten was reinforced in 1928 when Gropius received federal grants to carry out tests regarding different contruction methods and materials. Torten was as much a pragmatic response to a housing shortage as it was a test-environment for Bauhaus ideas - this contradiction became apparent almost immediately after initial construction.

![Dessau Torten Construction](/assets/unit-9/torten-construction-1.jpg)
**Figure 2:** Contemporary photograph showing a row of houses in Dessau Torten under construction.

Figure 2 shows a section of houses in Dessau Torten under construction. It highlights the rationalised construction Gropius designed: Rather than building each house individually, a whole section of identical houses was built at once. This photograph is part of an extensive series of professionally-executed photographs documenting the construction process. The fact that such extensive documentation was done can be attributed in part to the experimental nature of Torten - Gropius' experiments had to be documented to be scientifically valid. However, this photograph is more than a neutral document: The two small figures in the background and the dramatic lighting conditions give a monumental scale to the scene. The row of houses continues beyond the right edge of the photograph, reinforcing the feeling of scale. If we assume Gropius saw and approved this photograph, it gives us a sense of the tremendous optimism this architecture embodies. 

In this context it is also worth pointing out the contradiction between Gropius' distinctly modernist visual language (flat roofs, exposed construction, steel window frames) and the overall conception of the estate, which follows the concept of the garden city. The notion of the garden city was first proposed by Ebeneezer Howard in 1889, and runs somewhat contrary to the idea of the minimum dwelling as referenced by Gropius. Rather than "rationalising" food production in "kitchen factories that could feed 10.000" (Teige, 2012 p?), the garden city is based on the idea of individual self-sufficiency for each family. In Torten this takes the form of a 400 square metre garden attached to each dwelling. In addition, Gropius opted for specialised dry toilets (even though Torten was attached to the sewer network) to generate garden fertilizer.

![Dessau Torten Gardens](/assets/unit-9/torten-1920-2.jpg)
**Figure 3:** Contemporary photograph showing the garden side of row houses in Dessau Torten.

Another idea Gropius adopted from garden is that of mirrored floor plans. By positioning doors and windows at oppsing edges of the facade, Gropius is able to effectively blur the line between units. Rather than a row of identical houses, this creates the effect of a continuous band - Le Corbusier's "Machine for Living" stretched out like a conveyor belt.

## Alterations in the 1920s

We see the first major deviation from Gropius' plan the day the first families moved in. Few families could afford the RM 1350 for Marcel Breuer's specially designed furniture set, so they brought in an ecclectic collection of traditional furniture, wallpapers and curtains, which made an awkward fit in Gropius' small floor plans.

Following the initial construction, heat insulation quickly became a concern. Anectotal accounts describe how doors and windows would freeze shut during the first winter. This was a direct result of shortcomings in the design.

1. The steel frame, single glass windows chosen by Gropius were cutting-edge technology at the time. As such, they were not only a third more expensive than traditional wooden windows but also caused major heat loss due to their size and lack of insulation. Most of the original windows were replaced smaller, wooden windows by the mid-1930s. The new windows were also set much lower than the original windows, which started 1.40m above floor level (Gropius had made this choice to increase the usable floor area)
2. The thin outer walls formed another heat escape route. This was a direct result of their industrialised production - since their concrete slabs all had the same dimensions, heat bridges could form between the gaps. Home-owners addressed this by errecting secondary brick facades shortly after the initial construction.

Some individuals also began selling goods out of their houses, moving further away from the notion of centralised consumption. (Schwarting, 2011) This practice continues to date, as figure ? shows. 

## Alterations in Nazi Germany
The Bauhaus was always criticised as a source of communist thinking by right-wing observers. In the 1930s, the Nazi government made a number of alterations to the Torten Settlement (after earlier plans to rebuild it from the ground had proven financially unviable). Dessau architect and long-time critic of Gropius, Kurt Eisner was comissioned to develop a scheme to replace all of Gropius' steel windows with wooden ones. While this did also address construction issues, it was primarily seen as a propaganda victory by the nazis. Visually, changing the window positions broke up Gropius' continuous facade into individual units. A pavement and more pronounced seperation between neighbouring front gardens were also added in this period. (Schwarting, 2011)

A contemporary newspaper report celebrates the changes, describing how the "middle-eastern flat roofed architecture has been restored to German forms". (This strangely racist critique of modernist architecture is a recurring motif among critics of modern architecture at the time).

The desire to contrast modernist buildings with what was seen as proper, "volkisch" architecture might also explain why the Bauhaus building itself was surrounded by a grouping of pitched-roof, traditionally-built apartment buildings during this time.

## Alterations in the GDR

Immediately after the war, a number of buildings in Torten had to be rebuilt - Dessau, being the site of a Junkers factory had become a bombing target. Since little building material was available, many original components were re-used.

As the economic situation stabilised, people's focus tunrned toward expanding their living space. Houses were expanded into the garden, and in many cases the roof terrace in the back was enclosed to create an additional room. Most of the original dry toilets were replaced with regular flush toilets. Schwarting makes the observation that the reason these expansions could be done relatively easily was the construction of the buildings, in which only the side walls were load-bearing. The argument can be made that Gropius did in fact choose this construction method with later expansions in mind. This would be in line with his thinking regarding modular housing which can be expanded and downsized with the changing size of the family. 

Contemporary photographs also suggest that the orignal above-ground electricity lines were moved underground during this period, removing another element of industrial aesthetic from the view of the observer. 

One of the more memorable images from this time (fig ?) shows a row of houses, each with a tall anteanna supposedly used to illegally receive West-German TV. This is in a way a reversal of the earlier power structure: Rather than implementing a set of political ideals from the top down through architecture (as Gropius had done), individuals are making an architectural change to get around politically motivated restrictions. 

During this period the use of the gardens also changed substantially. As the need for individual food production became less pronounced, the gardens take up a more recreational role. The space is also used to accomodate the increasing number of private cars in the settlement. Car ownership in the GDR increased drastically from 0.2 cars per 100 housholds in 1955 to 40 in 1982 (Edwards, 1985). In response to this, many home-owners build garages and carports along the back edge of their property, transforming the gravel path between opposing gardens into a secondary road. Like earlier alterations, these additions appear to be largely done on an individual basis according to stylistic preference and financial means. 

## Alterations after 1989

Another significant set of changes to Torten come after the Berlin wall, largely due to the emergence of DIY-retail. With an abundance of facade materials, garden decorations, windows, doors and roofing materials suddenly available, home-owners made a series of individual changes that define the settlement today. 

Figures ? through ? show a wide variety of doors, windows, fittings, landscaping features and seasonal decorations. Surprisingly, elements of the original buildings such as house numbers and door handles still appear throughout the settlement, however not always in their original location - Figure ? shows original house numbers attached to a garage door along the secondary road.

With the increasing public recognition of the Bauhaus and its architectural output in the 1980s, education has become a permanent part of the Torten settlement. Hannes Meyer's Konsum building houses a museum telling the story of the settlement, and signs throughout the settlement point out various points of interest. Individual units have been purchased by the local government and restored to their original state. This is a costly process however, as building components that were mass-produced in the 1920s (such as single-glass steel windows) now have to be custom-manufactured.  

There was some legislation put in place in the late 1990s to prevent major structural changes, although as Schwarting points out this has its own set of problems - some of the regulations prescribe things that are inconsistent with the original drawings. (Maybe bring up the issue of colour here - we only have black and white photographs of the buildings giving the impression that they were all pristine white, when in reality they maybe had quite subtle colour choices)

Today, Torten is fully enveloped by industrial and residential areas built at various times - against the backdrop of blocks of high-rise social housing estates in the surrounding area, it seems almost romantic. 

## Is Dessau Torten a succesful experiment?

## Collectivist housing models today

Inequality, housing shortages today, people aren't as afraid of socialism anymore. Society has progressed from a Fordian industrial workforce to a service economy - production and transportation is more and more automated, posing the question wether the way we live needs to change in a major way again.

Architect Deane Simpson offers an interesting perspective on this in his 2015 book "The Young Old: Urban Utopias of an Ageing Society". In it, the author describes a new class of people created: the young old. These are people in their 50s and 60s, who have the financial means to retire and yet are healthy enough to continue to live an active life. Much like the industrial worker of the early 20th century, this is an entirely new class of people created by technological progress. Where in the 19th century the invention of the steam engine and fordist production methods brought about the industrial worker, it is andvances in medicine, nutrition and living conditions that cerated the young old. Like the industrial worker, the young old demand new solutions to the problem of housing, some of which seem remarkably similar to what Gropius and others were working on a century ago.

Simpson describes the "Huis Ten Bosh" settlement in Nagasaki, Japan, which is a retirement community modelled after a Dutch village. It features life-size reproductions of historic buildings in the Netherlands, carefully choreographed street performances and centralised social events. Residents live in pre-fabricated single-family homes along a grid of canals which serves as the primary means of transportation.

The resemblance between this and Gropius' ideas is striking: Take away the pitched roofs and tulip beds and you have a modernist housing development. The fact that not only architecture and transportation, but also cultural events and in some ways the social fabric of the settlement (there are strict rules governing who is eligible to purchase a house) are part of a "Gesamtkunstwerk" goes far beyond what Gropius was able to do. We find the notion of using architectural intervention to design social interaction on a much smaller scale in Hannes Meyer's work: His ADGB Trade Union School near Berlin (1928-1930) is designed to break students into groups of four - this was thought to be the ideal number to accomodate learning. But where Meyer was working toward a socialist future (he went on to work in the Soviet Union after he left the Bauhaus in 1930), developments like Huis Ten Bosch are privately funded and run for profit.

## Conclusions

Dessau torten isn't a clear cut case, they had to make compromises on materials, steel windows weren't as good as they are today, the concrete they made on site wasn't gerat etc. but it was all going in the correct direction. Stress the organisational aspect, also the fact it was governement funded is maybe a new thing? Basically the idea that modernism has survived in the sense that the torten buildings are flexible enough to be changed. maybe the futurist idea that part of their movement was the idea that the movement would eventually die. Socialism hasn't happened obviously, but this wasn't always the intention of the bauhaus, moholy nagy was more in favour of working with industry. notion of using rationale, science to make architecture cheaper has survived, although the idea of big social housing developments isn't as popular anymore (maybe show chemistry worker's city by former bauhausler, la housing blocks as examples)
