intro: "The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical artifacts: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, New Typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The philosophical and political struggle that led to these outcomes seems distant to us. Reading some of the manifestos published at the Bauhaus, written in somewhat stilted 1920s German can only give us a faint idea of the monumental endeavour the Bauhausler were engaged in."

Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, overlooking Dessau from their glass-wrapped studios this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was driven by the search for individual expression. Johannes Itten, with his head shaved and wearing a robe of his own design taught the now-famous Vorkurs: Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic exercises. The Sommerfeld House in Berlin with its excentric, hand-crafted decoration is an often-cited example for the expresionism of the early Bauhaus (Bauhaus100.de, 2017).

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more collective outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would come to define the "Bauhaus Style". The following year Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus. It was during this later period that Marcel Breuer produced furniture out of precision steel tube (then a cutting-edge material), Marianne Brandt designed household items for mass-production and Gropius himself completed some of the most iconic examples of modernist architecture (Droste, 1998).

Despite its academic success the Bauhaus was faced with political pressure from its inception. The increasingly right-wing government of Weimar forced the Bauhaus to move to Dessau. However, the rise of the Nazis on a national level brought the end of the Bauhaus. After a brief period in Berlin under the leadership of Mies van der Rohe, the remaining Bauhausler agreed to disband in 1933. Many were forced to flee Germany, which of course only served to spread Bauhaus ideas. Gropius, Breuer, Mies and others continued to teach in the United States, contributing to the emergence of the "International Style". (Wilder, 2016)

The architectural legacy of this period surrounds us to this day. I'm writing this from a 1960s university building with steel windows, concrete slab floors and curtain walls not dissimilar to what Gropius used 40 years prior in Dessau. Similar buildings can be found in cities all over the world. 

I'm laying out this background to explain the confilct I'm trying to reconcile: 

On one hand, there is the utopian vision of the Bauhausler: A world in which housing, transportation, appliances, culture and food is designed through a scientific process and mass-produced by machines to be affordable to everyone. By reducing forms to their functional minimum, the Bauhaus aimed to create universal solutions for housing, education and everyday life.

On the other hand, there is the image of the derelict post-war housing block popularised in the 1970s. Oscar Newman's 1972 study "Defensible Space: People and Design in the Violent City" linked modernist housing with increased crime, arguing that the spatial design of housing blocks makes them inherently unsafe, and that private space, rather than public space should be prioritized. Popular critics such as Tom Wolfe (1981) perpetuate the idea of modernist housing being fundamentally unfit for its purpose. Wolfe cites the widely publicized demolition of the Pruitt–Igoe housing estate in St. Louis in 1972 (only 20 years after its construction) as evidence for the failure of modernist principles. Although Newman's original conclusions have been criticised as being based on "problematic assumptions" (Steventon, 1996) they persist among policymakers (Beckett, 2016). On a basic level, this post-war critique of modernist housing seems to suggest that the idea of the "universal solution" in itself is flawed - that it is fundamentally at odds with people's inherent individualism. 

While attitudes toward modernist housing have become more favourable in recent years (Owen Hatherley here) the fundamental question remains: How does the modernist goal of "rational", universal solutions to problems of everyday life hold up against the individualism of the people inhabiting those solutions? Were the Bauhausler aware of this conflict, and were trying to reconcile it? 

To address these questions, I will first lay out how the architectural practice at the Bauhaus emerged and how it sits within the framework of modernist thinking. Next, I will discuss the Dessau-Torten housing estate by Walter Gropius as a manifestation of that practice, and the conflict between collectivist and individualist ideas within modernistm. For a number of reasons I will discuss, Torten has been subject to significant alterations since its construction. By following these alterations from the 1920s to present day, I will show how attitudes towards modernist ideas shifted over time in the context of late capitalism. In closing, I will argue that the present transition to a post-industrial economy has parallels to the emergence of industrialism in the beginning of the 20th century which warrant a re-examination of modernist ideas. 

## Architecture at the Bauhaus
"The ultimate goal of all art" at the Bauhaus, as Gropius declares in the 1919 manifesto, is architecture. He goes on to explain how "the new building" would unite all artistic disciplines:

> So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come.' (Gropius, 1919)

It is worth noting how Gropius is invoking medieaval imagery to talk about the future. The concept of craft guilds, which Gropius refers to in the opening sentence dates back to the 13th century. Further, the "building [...] that will unite every discipline [...] and which will rise heavenwards" is a clear reference to the medieaval cathedral. This is further emphasised by Lionel Feininger's "Cathedral" Woodcut used to illustrate the text (Burshart, 2009).  This turning back to medieaval concepts continues in the way teaching was organised at the Bauhaus: Rather than professors and students, Bauhausler were referred to as "masters" and "apprentices", with teaching taking palce primarily in the workshops (Droste, 1999). This positions Gropius' ideas, and indeed some of the early products of the Bauhaus (such as the Sommerfeld House) surprisingly close to those of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Christina Lodder describes these early Bauhaus ideas as part of a larger movement in search of "spiritual utopia". She argues that "a rejection of materialism and 19th-century positivist outlooks impelled painters associated with Expressionism to infuse the work of art with a spiritual dimension, and to promote the idea that art and architecture were thereby the means of saving mankind from modernity" (Lodder, 2006 Page 24). 

### Rational Utopia

The transition to a more rational, technology-focussed outlook at the Bauhaus came after the end of the first world war with the arrivals of Theo van Doesburg and Lazlo Moholy-Nagy in Weimar. This new direction was defined by the notion that scientific progress, industrial production and rational decision-making could be employed to solve the "materialism, repressive political structures and glaring social inequalities" of the present (Lodder, Page 33). From the prespective of modernists crime, disease, alcoholism and scoial inequality were directly linked to the "overcrowded cities", "old and rotten buildings and poor sanitary conditions" (Le Corbusier, 1923) that industralisation had left behind. 
Adolf Loos first talks about this idea in 1910: 

> [...] Ornament is not only produced by criminals; it itself commits a crime, by damaging men's health, the national economy and cultural development. [...] Even greater is the damage ornament inflicts on the workers. As ornament is no longer a natural product of our civilization, it accordingly represents backwardness or degeneration, and the labour of the man who makes it is not adequately remunerated.  (Loos, 1910)

A 1930 film titled "Das Neue Wohnen" [The new Living] illustrates this idea in striking images (Figure 0.1). Dark shots of derelict workers' homes are interspersed with scenes of domestic violence and disease. This is then set in contrast to the mdoernist vision of the future: Brightly lit shots of clean interiors with mass-produced, ornament-free furniture. The film ends with a title card announcing: "A better future will hold affordable and humane housing FOR EVERYONE" - emphasizing the aspiration for social equality that imbues modernist thinking.

![Das Neue Wohnen](/assets/unit-9/die-neue-wohnung-web.jpg)
**Figure 0.1**: Video stills from "Das Neue Wohnen" (1930)

The change in lighting from dark to bright in The New Living is no accident: The idea that sunlight and air would benefit people's health and even cure a wide range of diseases was widespread in the 1920s, as was the notion that personal hygiene and cleansiness would lead to a better society (Wilk, 2006). We see these ideas represented throughout modernist architecture, including Gropius. 

Gropius lays out his own version of these ideas in his 1925 book "Ein Versuchshaus des Bauhauses in Weimar" [A trial building by the Bauhaus in Weimar]. The title refers to the Haus am Horn in Weimar, which was built for the Bauhaus exhibition in 1923. In the introduction Gropius argues that the new age "makes it necessary to finally realise the old idea of building typical dwellinggs cheaper, better and in larger numbers to give every family access to healthy living conditions" (page 5). The way to achieve this, according to Gropius is to understand the housing problem "in its entire sociological, economical, technical and formal context". (page 5). Gropius also has some specific ideas on how these issues might be addressed. 

He argues that because most people have similar basic needs, housing should be uniform and mass-produced in specialised factories. Rather than building houses individually at the building site, they should be dry-assembled from pre-manufactured components using standardised blueprints. Gropius coins the term "large-scale building blocks" ["Baukasten im Grossen"] to describe this form of modular architecture. Figure 0.1 illustrates this idea: Individual components (labelled 1 though 6) are assembled into different "machines for living" according to the "number and needs of the inhabitants".

![Large Scale Building Blocks](/assets/unit-9/baukasten-im-grossen.jpg)
**Figure 0.1:** Illustration showing the concept of Gropius' "Large-Scale Building Blocks", published in Bauhausbuch 3: Ein Versuchshaus des Bauhauses in Weimar, 1925. Unknown artsit, Walter Gropius.

The artistic challenge, according to Gropius, lies in finding satisfying spatial arrangements of these building blocks. Gropius briefly mentions the idea that contrary to popular belief, smaller rooms might actually lead to better living conditions (Gropius, 1930). What he is referring to here is the idea of the "minimum dwelling"

This was reinforced from 1928, when Swiss architect Hannes Meyer took over the post of director from Walter Gropius. While Gropius argued that the artist should be part of the building process along with other experts, Meyer demands rigorous functionalism. In a 1926 article he declares: 

> Building is a biological process. Building is not an aesthetic process. Reduced to its elements, the new dwelling will be not just a machine for living, but a biological device to fulfill psychological and physical needs (Meyer 1926, Page 4)

In the same publication he lists the "schedules of people inside and outside the house, physical aspects of the building site, sunlight, acoustics and psychology" as datapoints that sohuld be used to inform architectural decisions. His architectural drawings are filled with tables and graphs describing the results of soil analysis, sunlight calculations and weather observations at the building site. Under the brief tenure of Mies van der Rohe from 1930 to 1933 the understanding of architecture at the Bauhaus shifted away from the strict functionalism of Hannes Meyer toward a more aesthetically-driven exploration of space.

## The Dessau-Torten Estate

Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1930, and countless more after the school disbanded (Engels, 2001). This count includes buildings that were built by Gropius and others relatively independently from the Bauhaus, but some were the result of the type of cross-discipline collaboration that was at the core of the Bauhaus idea. These large-scale projects addressed real-world issues while at the same time serving as cross-discipline classroom experiments at the Bauhaus.

A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (1920, destroyed 1945), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). However, it is the more obscure examples of Bauhaus architecture 

However, many more have escaped public attention for most of their existence. They were never regarded as architectural monuments, but used by the public like any other building - Many of them didn't receive heritage protection until very recently. As such they were altered, extended, worn down and painted over with little hesitation. We could lament this loss of architectural history (and people do), but in our search for evidence as to the success (or failure) of modernism, we couldn't get luckier. Here we have the physical manifestations of 1920s modernist ideals, tested mercilessly by regular people through decades of war, reconstruction and changing political regimes up to the present day. 

![Dessau Torten Aereal Photograph](/assets/unit-9/torten-aereal.jpg)
**Figure 1:** Aereal photograph of the Dessau Torten settlement today

The example I will be primarily discussing here is the housing estate Dessau-Torten. Designed by Walter Gropius and members of the Bauhaus, it consits of 314 single-family, terraced houses across roughly six square miles. The initial construction was completed in three phases from 1926 to 1928, with later expansions added by Hannes Meyer and Richard Paulick. (Bauhaus Dessau, 2017)

The Dessau Torten settlement takes a unique position in the physical legacy of the Bauhaus.   

After a planned housing project in Weimar had failed to materialise (only one building, the Haus am Horn, was ever completed), Torten was the first opportunity for Gropius to put the ideas he had developed during the early 1920s to practice on a large scale. In fact the prospect of building Torten was a major motivation for Gropius to move the Bauhaus to Dessau in the first place. The city of Dessau comissioned Torten to address a housing shortage caused by an influx of industrial workers that had 

Torten was part of a national effort to provide affordable housing to lower-income families. Individual units in Torten were sold for between RM 9.500 and RM 10.100, or around RM 35 per month - well within the reach of an average industrial worker (Schwarting, 2011). The fact that units were sold off to individuals is critical: It gave home-owners the freedom to make changes to their houses with few restrictions. Over 80 years, these changes have accumulated into a rich layering of architectural details. Peeling back these layers allows us to see how Gropius' original vision was adopted over time. 


## Initial Construction

While the Dessau government was looking for a pragmatic solution to a housing shortage, Gropius saw an opportunity to test ideas on archiectural language, construction technology and organisation on a large scale. The experimental natue of Torten was reinforced in 1928 when Gropius received federal grants to carry out tests regarding different contruction methods and materials. Torten was as much a pragmatic response to a housing shortage as it was a test-environment for Bauhaus ideas - this contradiction became apparent almost immediately after initial construction.

**Figure 2:** Contemporary photograph showing a row of houses in Dessau Torten under construction.

Figure 2 shows a section of houses in Dessau Torten under construction. It highlights the rationalised construction Gropius designed: Rather than building each house individually, a whole section of identical houses was built at once. This photograph is part of an extensive series of professionally-executed photographs documenting the construction process. The fact that such extensive documentation was done can be attributed in part to the experimental nature of Torten - Gropius' experiments had to be documented to be scientifically valid. However, this photograph is more than a neutral document: The two small figures in the background and the dramatic lighting conditions give a monumental scale to the scene. The row of houses continues beyond the right edge of the photograph, reinforcing the feeling of scale. All of this invokes the feeling of optimism and larger-than-life ambition that imbues Gropius' architecture. 

This image is featured along others in Gropius' 1930 book "Bauhausbauten Dessau", which suggests that Gropius was not only aware of the image, but approved of its message. 

In this context it is also worth pointing out the contradiction between Gropius' distinctly modernist visual language (flat roofs, exposed construction, factory-like steel fixtures) and the urban planning of the development, which follows the concept of the garden city. The notion of the garden city was first proposed by Ebeneezer Howard in 1889, and runs somewhat contrary to the idea of the minimum dwelling as referenced by Gropius. Rather than "rationalising" food production in "kitchen factories that could feed 10.000" (Teige, 2012 p?), the garden city is based on the idea of individual self-sufficiency for each family. In Torten this takes the form of a 400 square metre garden attached to each dwelling. In addition, Gropius opted for specialised dry toilets (even though Torten was attached to the sewer network) to generate garden fertilizer.

![Dessau Torten Gardens](/assets/unit-9/torten-1920-2.jpg)
**Figure 3:** Contemporary photograph showing the garden side of row houses in Dessau Torten.

Another idea Gropius adopted from garden is that of mirrored floor plans. By positioning doors and windows at oppsing edges of the facade, Gropius is able to effectively blur the line between units. Rather than a row of identical houses, this creates the effect of a continuous band - Le Corbusier's "Machine for Living" stretched out like a conveyor belt.

## Alterations in the 1920s

We see the first major deviation from Gropius' plan the day the first families moved in. Few families could afford the RM 1350 for Marcel Breuer's specially designed furniture set, so they brought in an ecclectic collection of traditional furniture, wallpapers and curtains, which made an awkward fit in Gropius' small floor plans.

Following the initial construction, heat insulation quickly became a concern. Anectotal accounts describe how doors and windows would freeze shut during the first winter. This was a direct result of shortcomings in the design.

1. The steel frame, single glass windows chosen by Gropius were cutting-edge technology at the time. As such, they were not only a third more expensive than traditional wooden windows but also caused major heat loss due to their size and lack of insulation. Most of the original windows were replaced smaller, wooden windows by the mid-1930s. The new windows were also set much lower than the original windows, which started 1.40m above floor level (Gropius had made this choice to increase the usable floor area)
2. The thin outer walls formed another heat escape route. This was a direct result of their industrialised production - since their concrete slabs all had the same dimensions, heat bridges could form between the gaps. Home-owners addressed this by errecting secondary brick facades shortly after the initial construction.

Some individuals also began selling goods out of their houses, moving further away from the notion of centralised consumption. (Schwarting, 2011) This practice continues to date, as figure ? shows. 

## Alterations in Nazi Germany
The Bauhaus was always criticised as a source of communist thinking by right-wing observers. In the 1930s, the Nazi government made a number of alterations to the Torten Settlement (after earlier plans to rebuild it from the ground had proven financially unviable). Dessau architect and long-time critic of Gropius, Kurt Eisner was comissioned to develop a scheme to replace all of Gropius' steel windows with wooden ones. While this did also address construction issues, it was primarily seen as a propaganda victory by the nazis. Visually, changing the window positions broke up Gropius' continuous facade into individual units. A pavement and more pronounced seperation between neighbouring front gardens were also added in this period. (Schwarting, 2011)

A contemporary newspaper report celebrates the changes, describing how the "middle-eastern flat roofed architecture has been restored to German forms". (This strangely racist critique of modernist architecture is a recurring motif among critics of modern architecture at the time).

The desire to contrast modernist buildings with what was seen as proper, "volkisch" architecture might also explain why the Bauhaus building itself was surrounded by a grouping of pitched-roof, traditionally-built apartment buildings during this time.

## Alterations in the GDR

Immediately after the war, a number of buildings in Torten had to be rebuilt - Dessau, being the site of a Junkers factory had become a bombing target. Since little building material was available, many original components were re-used.

As the economic situation stabilised, people's focus tunrned toward expanding their living space. Houses were expanded into the garden, and in many cases the roof terrace in the back was enclosed to create an additional room. Most of the original dry toilets were replaced with regular flush toilets. Schwarting makes the observation that the reason these expansions could be done relatively easily was the construction of the buildings, in which only the side walls were load-bearing. The argument can be made that Gropius did in fact choose this construction method with later expansions in mind. This would be in line with his thinking regarding modular housing which can be expanded and downsized with the changing size of the family. 

Contemporary photographs also suggest that the orignal above-ground electricity lines were moved underground during this period, removing another element of industrial aesthetic from the view of the observer. 

One of the more memorable images from this time (fig ?) shows a row of houses, each with a tall anteanna supposedly used to illegally receive West-German TV. This is in a way a reversal of the earlier power structure: Rather than implementing a set of political ideals from the top down through architecture (as Gropius had done), individuals are making an architectural change to get around politically motivated restrictions. 

During this period the use of the gardens also changed substantially. As the need for individual food production became less pronounced, the gardens take up a more recreational role. The space is also used to accomodate the increasing number of private cars in the settlement. Car ownership in the GDR increased drastically from 0.2 cars per 100 housholds in 1955 to 40 in 1982 (Edwards, 1985). In response to this, many home-owners build garages and carports along the back edge of their property, transforming the gravel path between opposing gardens into a secondary road. Like earlier alterations, these additions appear to be largely done on an individual basis according to stylistic preference and financial means. 

## Alterations after 1989

Another significant set of changes to Torten come after the Berlin wall, largely due to the emergence of DIY-retail. With an abundance of facade materials, garden decorations, windows, doors and roofing materials suddenly available, home-owners made a series of individual changes that define the settlement today. 

![Dessau Torten Doors](/assets/unit-9/dessau-doors-web.jpg)
**Figure 4:** Photographs showing the variety of front doors in Dessau Torten. The top left photograph shows the door of Doppelreihe 35, which is the only original 1920s door remaining in the settlement. 

Figures ? through ? show a wide variety of doors, windows, fittings, landscaping features and seasonal decorations. Surprisingly, elements of the original buildings such as house numbers and door handles still appear throughout the settlement, however not always in their original location - Figure ? shows original house numbers attached to a garage door along the secondary road.

![Dessau tourist signage](/assets/unit-9/dessau-map.jpg)
**Figure 5:** Signage in Dessau-Torten pointing out various points of interest.

With the increasing public recognition of the Bauhaus and its architectural output in the 1980s, public education has become a permanent part of the Torten settlement. In 1992 the first house was restored to its original state by a private foundation. Since then, a number of houses have been restored to various degrees by either the local government or their respective owners. (The notion of "original state" here is debatable - Many components that were mass-produced in the 1920s have to be custom-manufactured now. In the nearby Bauhaus building this goes as far as adding artificial "inconsistencies" to glass panels to achive a more "authentic" visual effect.) Further, signage pointing out various features (Fig. 5) as well as regular groups of architectural tourists enter the urban structure of the estate. Hannes Meyer's Konsum building now houses a permanent exhibition documenting the history of the estate.  

There was some legislation put in place in the late 1990s to prevent major structural changes, although as Schwarting points out this has its own set of problems.

Today, Torten is fully enveloped by industrial and residential areas built at various times - against the backdrop of blocks of high-rise social housing estates in the surrounding area, it seems almost romantic. 

## Is Dessau Torten a succesful experiment?

It's easy to point out flaws with Gropius' plan for Torten. In his writings he argues for an architecture that is focussed on the needs of the people,  yet in Torten he seems happy to compromise on those needs in order to try out new materials and construction methods - the amount of alterations that had to be done shortly after the initial construction speaks to this. Further, we might come to the conclusion that Gropius' aesthetic programme failed as well: The second their economic situation allowed it, people covered up the white facades, swapped out the steel windows and decorated their front lawns. Rather than living in the homogenous machine for living Gropius had imagined, home-owners did everything in their power to differentiate themselves visually from their neighbours.

However the opposite case can also be made. Yes, people drastically changed the original floorplan to satisfy their needs. But the reason this could be done relatively easily and cheaply goes back to Gropius' modern construction, in which only the side walls are load-bearing. We can further argue that recent alterations, enabled by DIY-retail, are in fact a continuation of Gropius' concept of large-scale building blocks. Today components such as windows, doors, house numbers, garden plants and seasonal decorations are mass-produced, and designed to be assembled with little specialist knowledge or equipment - much like Gropius was imagining. 

## Collectivist housing models today

Modernist social housing was in many ways a response to the emergence of a new social class: the industrial worker. After the first world war rising industrial towns like Dessau attracted an influx of workers, leading to a sudden population increase the existing housing and infrastructure wasn't fit to handle. This led to the poor living conditions modernist architects recognised and attempted to improve through large-scale urban developments. As Daniel Bell (1999) shows, we now find ourselves in a similar societal transition - from an industrial society to a post-industrial one. According to Bell, this transition is marked by a number of factors: Agriculture and manufacturing are replaced by sercives as the primary source of employment ("services" meaning transportation and logistics, as well as education and healthcare). Further, the importance of physical infrastructure (roads, trains) decreases as "intellectual infrastructure" (internet connections, computing power) becomes the primary way to generate capital. As the industrial revolution created the industrial worker, the transition to a post-industrial society is likely to create new classes of people with new housign needs. 

We can see this process happening in front of us already. Deane Simpson (2015) describes a new class of people created entirely by scientific progress and the abundance of services in the post-industrial age: the "Young-Old". First described by Berncie Neugarten in 1974, the Young-Old are people at retirement age with higher purchasing power, higher likelihood living independently from their families, more education and better health status than those previously in their age group. According sociologist Andrew Blaikic, the Young-old might be the first large demographic group in history "whose daily experience [does] no consist of work or schooling [...]" (Simpson, p13)

According to Simpson, the emergence of the Young-Old can be linked to two factors aligned with Bell's analysis of the post-industrial society. First, advances in public health, nutrition and the decline of manual labour has led to an increased life expectancy in both industrial and developing countries - doubling from 40 years in 1840 to 80 years in 2000. Medical products developed over the last century, such as the artificial hip, the contact lens, electronic hearing aids and Viagra extend the physical capabilities of the body. This is in line with Bell's notion of a shift towards human services as the primary economic sector. Secondly, the decline of the multi-generational family creates a class of retirees that has to be more self-reliant than previous generations. Again this can be linked to Bell's description of post-industrialism: "Intellectual Work" can be done independently from any physical location. This in turn creates what Simpson describes as the "[increased] mobility requirements of the modern workforce, which drives people apart geographically" (Simpson, 2015, p ?).

Where in the 19th century the invention of the steam engine and fordist production methods brought about the industrial worker, it is scientific progress and the shift from industrial to intellectual work that brings about the Young-Old. They have the desire, health and financial means to live independently, thus making the institutional homes of previous generations unfit. At the same time, shifts in the labour market and changes in traditional values have made the traditional model of the multi-generational household unavailable (or undersireable). The only response to this new class of people seems to be the development of new housing models.

Simpson describes a number of these new housing models, including the "The Villages", a vast themed retirement community outside Orlando, Florida. With a population of 157.000 in 2016 (Rocco, 2015), The Villages are not only the largest retirement commmunity in the world, but America's fastest growing city overall. In many ways, they bear a striking resemblance to the social housing developments of the 1920s: Houses are mass-produced and laid out following a pre-conceived plan. Transportation, architecture, health care, local history, media and (by virtue of age- and income segregation) the social fabric of the settlement are part of a "Gesamtkunstwerk" of a scope far beyond what Gropius was able to do.

The developers are surprisingly candid about their methods. The settlement is split up into smaller "towns", each with its own, entirely fabricated local history. The developers use techniques developed in theme parks to artificially age buildings, and even go so far as to install fictional historical artifacts and historical plaques to create a feeling of local history. All of this is done (apparently succesfully) to encourage the kind of social interaction between residents that represent an idealised idea of life in a small town.

(developer quote here)

The primary means of transportation in the villages is the golf cart. This is another specific design decision by the developer: The golf cart bridges the gap between the automobile (which is costly, associated with the working life and requires a licence, which residents may have lost or never acquired in the first place if they relied on their spouse to drive) and the mobility scooter (which is slow and associated with frailty and failing health). The developer encourages golf cart use by making specific golf cart roads, bridges and tunnels part of the urban planning, and incorporating golf cart-related events (such as parades) into the social programme. This is reiterated by The Village's marketing material which often refers to points of interest being "only a short golf cart ride away".

We find the notion of using architectural intervention to design social interaction on a much smaller scale in Hannes Meyer’s work: His ADGB Trade Union School near Berlin (1928-1930) is designed to break students into groups of four - this was thought to be the ideal number to accomodate learning.

In marketing material for the villages we even find echoes of the 1920s notion of heliotherapy, for instance these song lyrics from a 2011 video advert showing landscape shots and residents interacting in bright sunlight:

> It's a little slice of paradise / Sunshine and golf galore / Neighbours stroll the old town square / And the good life is in store / The Villages / Where the sun shines all year round / The Villages / Florida's friendliest hometown / From our family to yours / From our family to yours / Come on / Come on down / We're Florida's friendliest hometown

(The Villages Florida, 2011).

The Villages are a fascinating case to some extent because they map so closely to 1920s modernist visions of social housing. Their success warrants a re-examination of modernist housing projects as a potential approach towards present housing crisis. To some extent this debate is already taking place in the United Kingdom, with emerging writers such as Owen Hatherley questioning the disdain towards modernist housing of the 1970s. This is in line with a broader re-examination of socialist ideas following a growing sense of disillusionment with the results of economic liberalism, illustrated for instance by Shrimpton et. al (2017):

> Our survey findings show that Britons no longer think young people will have a
better life than previous generations, with only around one quarter (23 per
cent) of adults taking this view. Instead, roughly half (48 per cent) believe that
millennials will have a worse life than their parents.

However, I would argue that given the magnitude of societal change we're experiencing, a more radical departure from the models of modernist housing is needed. The level of infrastrucutre and knowledge available to us should allow us to think about housing models perhaps closer to what Gropius suggested in an offhand remark in 1925:

> Perhaps "mobile living-shells" ["mobile Wohngehause"], allowing us to take with us all the conveniences of a real [traditional] living standard even through relocations, are no longer too far-fetched a utopia. (Gropius, 1925 p5 )

Simpson describes a model of living that seems to come close to this: A significant population of young-old retirees permanently living in motorhomes. Using advanced communication technology, satellite navigation and modern highway infrastructure, these people migrate from north to south with the seasons, communicating via the internet and parking their vehicles in semi-permanent formations for only days at a time before dispersing again.

It is worth asking whether this mode of living, detached from any permanent location and built on modern technology isn't ultimately the more appropriate than earlier models in the context of a post-industrial society.
