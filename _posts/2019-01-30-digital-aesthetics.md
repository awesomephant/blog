- *Empire* by Andy Warhol basically started *structuralist film*
- P. Adams Sitney coins the term, see also [Structural Film Antology](https://monoskop.org/images/6/65/Gidal_Peter_ed_Structural_Film_Anthology.pdf) by Peter Gidal
- A lot of structuralist film came out of the London film-makers co-op
- *[Room Film 1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axucqo_SNLo)* by Peter Gidal. He's showing the same shot over and over again — back then a hugely laborious thing to do (you'd have to physically make copies of the film). This is *film about film*, exposing the underlying mechanics of film-making, or *film as film*.
- *[Ray Gun Virus (1966)](https://vimeo.com/17173209)* by Paul Sharits
- *[Dresden Dynamo (1971)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7xoNWzm7PQ)* by Rhodes Lis. Note that the sound comes from her drawing directly onto the film (which contains sound information in visual form).
- *[Berlin Horse (1970)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDj8Tc6259o)* by Malcom Le Grice

All of these people are making work about analogue film — digital images work entirely differently:

Multiple pixels, with RGB-coloured filters are needed to capture colour images. [Source](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/astrophotography-tips/redeeming-color-planetary-cameras/)

Cameras (especially phones) apply all kinds of digital optimisations to images: Simple things like bringing up the saturation, increasing the contrast, but also more advanced operations like smooting out skin, morphing bodyparts to make them look more "attractive".

When images are shared online, there's additional processes like scaling and compression. Any screen you look at a photograph on is doing its own, interanl optimisations to it.

All of this is to say, digital images have a limited link with reality (certainly not the chemical index that analogue material represents).

Let's make a digital film that explores some of the inherent characteristics of digital images (in the same way the structuralists made films abotu analogue film-making).

- Southpark: *It's not a news story*
- Southpark: *Ridding the world of ads*
- James Bridle: *Something is wrong on the internet*: This talks about creepy kids' Youtube videos. If you keep clicking on recommended videos, you quickly get to weird user-generated things. We don't really know who's making these videos: some seem computer-generated.
- *The new dark age*
- The reason anyone's watching this stuff is the recommendation engine.
- You now get Youtube Kids and Netflix Kids.

Let's step away from this stuff for a second.

- Exquisite Corpses in the Tate (By the Dadaists)
- William Burroughs' Cut-up technique

### Predictive text poems

Tap the first one 20 times.

Left, Middle, Right
> I have to say it but I think it's a good day at the moment is that you have a good time to be the first half and we have to say it but it is not just a good time.

'John Berger', then left
> John Berger said that the first half and we have to say it but I think it's a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day

Only middle suggestion:

> Tap the first half and we have to say it but I think it's a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand I think I have a good day and the other hand

Only right suggestion:

- *Sunspring* (2018): a bit contrived.
- John Smith (1992): *Gargantuan*

Ways of subverting machines/systems:

- Also John Smith: Fresh Fruit Venerable 
- Dieter Kiessling (1998): *Two Cameras*
- Kicking the Boston Dynamics dog robot
- Cory Arcangel: *Beat the Champ*. Not unlike people having their Amazon Echo and Google Home talk to each other.

All of these tend to go back to the human creator: Look at was this genius artist made this machine do. *Sunspring* is (maybe) more of an equal collaboration. [Obvious Art](https://obvious-art.com/) made the Sotheby's painting.
