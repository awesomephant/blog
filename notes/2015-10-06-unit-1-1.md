## Why do we study design history?

Design history is a tool we can use to understand our own work better. It helps us understand what it means to be modern. We need to be active about knowledge, challenge it. "Knowledge is not for knowing, knowledge is for cutting"

## Industrial revolution

The industrial revolution brought huge changes in agriculture and industry. Modernity is about progress.

With industrial progress comes change to the way people live

## Separation of Labour

Way of production that allows each worker to focus on just one small task. This allows for greater productivity, the use of specialised machines. Leads to a loss of ownership, the individual worker has no connection to the final product.

modernity is about adopting an attitude to change
