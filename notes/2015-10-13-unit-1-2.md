Edward Calvert shows an image of a mythical version of the past rather than the present. His work is full of symbolism, Greek mythology and Christian figures.

Although Palmer looks back at a past that never existed, his means of communication are modernist. He simplifies shapes, colours and textures down to their essence to make his message more impactful.

## People Palmer had Influence on

## Ideology of Sentiment

modernism is about utility but draws back to the past

- Downtown Abbey
- The Rubbish Men
- Thatcher's Cider

to move forwards you have to look backwards
