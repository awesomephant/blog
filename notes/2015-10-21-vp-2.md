## Nasty Gal

Nasty Gal is a fast-growing clothes brand. They work with lots of different designers, freelancers and interns, so they needed some way to introduce consistency.
A full brand styleguide would have been too limiting, so Colophone designed three bespoke typefaces for them.

- NG Grot 1
- NG Grot 2
- NG Grot 3

- No traditional Regular, Bold and Light weights, instead three distinct versions of the typeface that can be used in different ways
- Alternate characters, Alternate punctuation
- Automatic application of certan stylistic elements through Open Type features

## Castledown School

![Type specimen showing different cuts of the castledown typeface.](/assets/notes/castledownin.jpg)

- Type family for Castledown Primary School
- Combination of different attributes from Arial, Times and Comic Sans
- Relates to handwriting

Three different cuts:

1. Castledown Regular
2. Castledown Fun (rationalised comic sans)
3. Castledown Cursive & Castledown Cursive Instructional

The cursive version was a technical challenge, they used Open Type to create natural ligatures between chracters, each character has up to 14 different versions
stylistic alternates
