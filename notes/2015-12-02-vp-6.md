Adriaen van Utrecht, _Vanitas Still Life with Flowers and Skull_, 1642. Oil on canvas, 67 x 86 cm.

- Flemish Vanitas Painting
- Always about meaninglessness of life, fragility of life
- Heavy Symbolism: skull, candle, rotten fruit to represent death, decay
- Most art at the time was religious, so these still lifes were new and interesting
- Fairly modern in terms of composition and lighting

absolute representation of the goal of a photograph: being looked at

## Questions

### A lot of your pictures seem to require very elaborate physical setups. (Having pieces of marble cut to shape, complex lighting setups). Surely, a lot of this could be achieved a lot cheaper digitally. Why do you choose to not do that?

a big part of the work is that it is real
there is a return to a reality of real objects
shot on film medium format
even if you dont see the effort, the fact that is real makes it more impactful
human aspect, engage with real people, going around london or whereever finding stuff
if ou do it digitally you loose contact
obvious retouch is interesting, show process

obvious alterations in digital are an interesting thing to look at

### Could you talk a bit more about how you use lighting to convey meaning in your photographs

the light is one of the most important tool to show an intention, you have to have an intention in your lighting that tells a narrative
lighting surrounds the oobject to make them appear hyper real

lighting is difficult when you're not in the studio
huge setup, multiple lights
light up background, foreground, different layers of light
some of them have 7 different light sources to create perfect reflections, can get quite technical

### when you are building compositions, do you follow certain rules

composition, choice of objects main problem of the work
secondary objects to surround the main subjects and create a narrative
theres not really a system, but often a sense of humor
things people can relate to (pop culture references)

### Does the symbolism overpower the visual integrity

hopefull it doesnt. You often see geometric shapes and stuff, hopefull the actual meaning isn't sactrificed to create composition
the pictures would say something else when they looked different, very precise message
