## Stuff that has influenced me

- superheroes, superhero fingerpuppets
- record sleeves (beatles)
- pop art imagery
- comics (archie as purehart the powerful) colours, print, ragged edges of pages, poor print quality
- walt disney
- Belgian comics (Blake et Mortimer). Belgian comics are very much unlike American ones. They are beautifully printed, hard cover books with serious stories and very high quality drawing.
- Maurice Tillieux: _Gil Jourdan_

![Comic book open to a double-page image showing an enormous red machine. Smaller figures are in the foreground. Speech bubble reads "BEHOLD, KRO -- MY LITTLE GIFT TO THE GODS"](/assets/notes/jack-kirby-eternals-splash-pages-2.jpg)
Jack Kirby's Marvel comics. Amazing futuristic scenes, machines, ridicolous stories like superman vs frankenstein

- Children's activity books. Reduced shapes, limited colour palette, leaves a lot up to the imagination
- Comic lettering. Huge drop shadows, conveys excitement

Men Only magazine covers (1940s). Loose linework, flat colour.

- Never mind the bollocks, here's the sex pistols
- Saul Steinberg: The Discovery of America
- Herg√©: Tintin, End Papers
- Go 2 Record Sleeve. "This is a record cover. This writing is the design upon the record cover [...]"

## My own work

- Mostly editorial illustration
- Advertising for Ben and Jerry's Foundation
- [Gravitylight](http://www.benjerry.co.uk/whats-new/gravity-light-kapow), We walk the line
- Own work as a break from comercial work
- Editorial jobs give you all sorts of different subjects to work on, most random stuff

## Stuff I look at

- Shop signage
- Lettering
- Ice cream vans
- Neon signage
- Random stickers
- Lettering with snow on top
- Straightforward shop names

## Process

- Pencil drawings
- Brush and ink black line art
- Digital colouring
- Very rarely meet my own clients (all through email, agency)
- Work from a shared studio

### Super Book for Superheroes

- workshops with kids
- book has developed into its own thing
- The Superhero Comic Kit
- Coming up: Superhero Adventure Playset (paper engineering, pop-up book)

## Questions

### Do you have any advice for finding a good workspace?

- We just replied to an ad
- The market is getting more competetive
- Renting a place is definitely a learning process
- Find a group of people you like working with and set up a studio with them
- People will change over time
- Split the rent between a number of people
