friday career skill thing
Make a list of stuff you are good at
4 things to research when you're writing a cv, making a pitch etc

## Creative Attributes Framwork

elements that are part of you personality

## Learning outcomes

you should know what each briefs expects you to learn

## prospects.ac.uk

[https://www.prospects.ac.uk/](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/)

career planning thing
has job profiles written by recent graduates

## job descriptions

Use language that is used in job prospects when you are writing your CV, it's not about being teh most original person. Look at current job offers to find out what industry is asking for, keep updating your CV. This will help you build a well-articulated picture of what you're able to do.

## articulating skills

for every skil you have you should have a story about the time you used the skill to good effect. A framework for telling a good story about a skill:

- **S** What was the situation
- **T** What was the task
- **A** What actions did you take
- **R** What were the results

(acronyms are stupid)

Use research techniques when it comes to writing CV, planning your career and things

## outcomes
