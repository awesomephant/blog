Important to have a conversation about automation - tons of jobs will be replaced by machine learning etc.

Myths:

1. AUtomayion is a good thing. It will and already has disrupted many aspects of our lives. Often has negative outcomes on a lot of people
2. Automation is bad. The potential from automated production is immense. If benefits can be distributed things will be great
3. auomation is purely an economic thing. Washing machine is a better progressive technology than your phone. No ones ever been relieved when their wm broke, wheres we are with phones.
4. Automation cannot affect artists and designers, eg its irrelevant to our practice. What kind of economci support will there be for the art when service jobs will be taken away - how will artists fiance shit. What new recource will be available from us from automation, distribution, vr, production, 3d printing, materials. It's up to us to afect what vocab and imagery we use to talk about new technology. We use science fiction to talk about automation, which comes from people like us. What narratives do we use to talk about automation

Who makes and who is made
Salmon vaccination machine
Harroway: Cyborg Manifesto

Dialysis ward
people talk about their relationship with the machines
people feel like they're slaves to the machine - "it keeps you alive but it also keeps you prisoner"
Are you a cyborg? These folks can't live without the machines.
Made a response where sheep is a dialysis machine. Retired greyhound becomes mechanical ventilator. Tension between a organic technological device

FOund a room for discarded machines. The Immortal. All sorts of life support machines are connected to each other, there just isn't a patient. Minerals are added and removed. They're keeping each other alive forever, pumping around a blood replacement forever. THe installation takes up a room whereas the same system in our body only takes up a smaller space
fritc kahn, human body seen as industry palace. Body seen as a factory of blood and oxygen. Installation reflects how western medicine sees our body'same

## 75 Watt (2015)

> A loabourer over he course of an 8 hour day can sustain an average output of 75 watts

Designed an object that has no function except to create a coreogtapy of chinese workers assembling it in a factory. All the dimensions and stuff exists to create a specific movement. Got access to the factory and filmed the assembly. Made 45 objects + a film

tension between machines trying to act like bodys, bodys asked to behave like machines
Made in china, communism vs capitalism etc

Art can't exists outside of real world production, we have to reconstruct stuff from the inside

long exposure photography to reveal the efficiency and inefficiency of factory workers. Lights placed on workers hands and # text

The principles of scientific management

early 20 century, when the conveyor belt started to become a thing.

## Kingyo Kingdom

work around goldfish and the body of the animal. relationship with goldfish, nature. Fish that don't exist in nature. The more unnatural the fish are the more succesful they tend to be in competitions. Super long history back to edo period. -> bonsai breeding
Symbolised nature
production of fish as a technical, economic, social, cultural process. Worked with a scientist to make a batch of goldfish fo them that can't reproduce, that doesn't have any reproductive organs. Living organism as an object, living art object. Lifestyle pets. com show up sterile so you can't make more of the and ruin the business model

made a machine that can make a goldfish that can't reporduce. Injects fish embryos etc
What happens when the fish die etc

## ongoing project

> whenever in the last century and a half there was an acute demand for a certain mineral on the international market - ivory in vistorian ...

minerals used in technology comes from congo fo rthe most part, ongoing confilct etc
we carry around with us a bt of a place that we know nothing about
often at the start of industral production is a kid with a shovel

Hacking the future of money (book)

Things that are on the market have utility and some human production process attached to them
human labour component is being eroded
outputs of one production cycle can be inputs for a new cycle

capitalist production

- private property systems
- money systems
- markets

You enter markets to get inputs (eg raw materials, labour) to create outputs
people who make the stuff don't own the machines (eg means of productions)

automation is about making machines to replace manual labour, that's why there is so much investment

people think service economy is divorced from raw recources, but it relies on phones eg copper and whatnot
Tools take human force and amplify it
Now a machine is an assembly of interconnected parts, and it has a non-human energy source. They have an interface that allows you to interact with them. You don't operate the machine directly
A **Robot** is a machine that is able to make forms of limited descisions. It can take in information from teh environment and send out an output to make itself do something. More advanced robots have more sensors, more options of actions.
People tend to think of robots as human forms, but most of them don't look anything like that
**Computers** have inputs and outputs
So now we're connecting computers eg the interent. You've made a **Meta Computer**

Algorobotic systems
eg Uber, algorithmic system with inputs, datacenter and at the end an actual person in a car

## Domestic automation

gender and labour, gender as a kind of labour, social reporductio eg reporductive labour. Nurturing the next generation of workers. Thinking of the home as another waged and unwaged workplace. Think about the kinds of work that happen in the home.

Women race and class

scoial structures are reinforced by the primitiveness of home labour, hasn't been much affected by automation ect. Domestic labour saving devices do not actually have a great track record when it comes to saving time.

why has time spent not gone down? As appliances became a thing, standards shot up. stuff had to be cleaner, education more intense to give kids an advantage, food supposed to be much more complex. Applicances ma y be used to increase output rathr that reducing the burdnen on indiviual workers.

banana slicer
slushy machines
roomba

looks fancy but creates additional maintainance eg cleaning the filter etc, replacement parts new batteries. It's taking up more time somewhere else that what it's saving in one particular area.

the maret is interested in selling us stuff, not changing traditional family labour

Jibo, the first social robot for the home
seriously
GOing back to 1960s vision of the future

technology is shown as seperate from traditional Domestic family life

it's not all bad eg assistive technology, contraceptive pill, bicycle etc
a lot of domestic applicances are an afterthought from military, commercial use, eg the microwave, fridge

considerations have to go beyond jsut the smart home into what family structure we live in, forms of relationships, forms of organisations we work in

xenofeminist Manifesto

Feminists in the 20th century already imagined how the built environment could be changed to reduce the amount of labour required. Also bigger groups of people as opposed to traditional family sprads work around and makes shopping etc more efficient
