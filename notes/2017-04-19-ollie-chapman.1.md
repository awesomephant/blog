### did you ever consider setting smothing up with classmates

yes, camberwell press kind of became that, if it wasnt fo rthat we probs could have done a studio. But we did the logo, made the website got funding eg the sme stuff you do when you start a business, but without much of the risk involved

### recruitement: what do different places look for, moross and up

moross has only 10 oeiple, so it's very much about finding the right type of person, gotta fit in etc
mosross got interns, people applying for jobs and they were technically good but didn't really fit into the enviromnent

uo is a much bigere place, youre more of a cog in a machine, you get a lot of people working for a year and moving on, the ppeople arent as emotionally invested, they hire more for technical skills

### how do you balance your portfolio digital / print

depends where youre going, uo is looking for digital stff, place like moross mught be okay with more printmaking stuff. Also tweak you portfolio depending on where you're going to apply

### how beneficial is it to have a ba over and fda

the fda is really idustry focus (eh) if your work is god you shouldn't need that extra letter on you qualification. The ba is more about being experimental, idea generation. Also you're probably more likely to move up quicker with the education you get on a degree.

Also if youre doing bigger projects it shows that you're able to do management, sit in meetings, hire a van etc
