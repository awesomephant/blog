Unit 7 Photographing work

decent photos is the foundation of a good portfolio
often scanning makes sense (if surface quality / printing doesn't matetr as much)
digital work can go straight online obv
if you're photographing work, think about how it will look on your website - do you need a coloured background, what's the industr precedent etc
various small books
hyperkit cool diagonal photos

document work as you go along
show progress, becomas an extension of the work itself - Moving Brands
Timelapse stuff etc
photographic work in context eg someone looking at a map you designed
makes your work more believable etc
lights at 45 deg to avoid glare
