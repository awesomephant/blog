## Typography and type design work

![Boymans Specimen](/assets/notes/radim-pesko-boymans.png)
[Boymans (2003)](http://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/boymans)

Custom typeface for the redesign of the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Based loosely on the typeface created for the [1968 Mexico Olympics](http://graphicambient.com/2012/07/26/1968-mexico-olympics-mexico/).
Modular geomtric typeface, unlike the 68 identity this was developed into a system containing 30 styles (10 weights, each comes in one, two, or three line variants) These are used together to create the visual identity for the museum.

![Mitim Specimen](/assets/notes/radim-pesko-mitim.png)

[Mitim (2005-2010)](http://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/mitim)

Dot Dot Dot magazine (Graphic design magazine, ran from 2001 to 2010, 20 issues total, [here's the website](http://www.dot-dot-dot.us/)) approached him to help unify the design of the magazine starting from issue 10. Designing a custom typeface would achieve this while still allowing a large degree of freedom within each individual issue.

Had to be highly readable (the magazine was pretty text heavy), 3 point serifs. From issue 11 each issue had a new iteration of the typeface with adjustements, going from Mitim Alpha (Dot Dot Dot No. 11) to Mitim Lambda (Dot Dot Dot No. 20). This unique structure allowed the design to evolve over time, with different people collaborating on specific issues.

> Q: Is there a big difference between making a typeface for a specific design project and making one for commercial release?

Definitely. With a commercially released typeface you want to reach a certain technical standard (in terms of kerning tables, having a complete character set etc.), in a way to make the typeface idiot proof. In a way it becomes more of an end product, so automatically you have a higher standard regarding the quality of your drawing. Also once you put something online it will be there forever, so you want it to be finished.

If you're makiing something for a specific project or for a specific designer to work with they're going to be aware that stuff isn't finished. They know how to use the typeface correctly, how to use it to its strength and not show the weaker parts.

Grew confident enough to use typefaces in other design projects

started using typefaes in own work
![Fugue Specimen](/assets/notes/rp-fugue.jpg)
[Fugue (2008)](http://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/fugue)

Fugue was designed for ‘Wonder Years’, 2008 publication marking the tenth anniversary of the Werkplaats Typograﬁe in Arnhem.

Realised he was spending loads of time making a typeface that would only be used for a single project, started the foundry. [Yet Tschichold Sneezes specimen](http://www.radimpesko.com/specimen). Making a typeface takes ages:

- You start with Ag to get an idea for the face
- Then you do the basic latin character set
- Months later you do cyrillic
- Many more months later you finsih the full character set
- Extra months later you do italics
- Years later you have a family
- Eventually you want to give it a name, contextualize it, do marketing for it etc.

2016 czcheck movie posters
back in theday when you imported a film you wouldnt adapt the poster but instead a local designer would make aposter with limited recources and with only a plot summary or a single image of the frame

g4 paper was one of the proects (fake paper format)
this was usedd for the publication which then made it rel again

## qs

where do visual refs come from
most of the time its a matter of having an idea fro a single character and working arounf it. mking a typeface is suc a long process you want to make it interstedig enough so you're gonna stick to it

its not about individual characters or technical detals, they are meant to be used in sequence. zooming in zooming out
