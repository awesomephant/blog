concept art as a career option not really embracede enoughh

production paintings
brought in right at the startm no director, no designer yet, they need images to attract investors, ring everyone on he same page, you do key moments, keyframes from teh script

ghost in the shell
major coming into a restaurant scene (its ni tthe ytrailer)

a combination of show ing the producers the designers idea for a set

almpst entirely done in photoshop, also stuff done in skecthup, not as prescptiev as bigger 3d packages, it's almost like line art for you to work from, you're ot too trapped in the render

1. buil a crude sketchup model, get reference, find some good angles, digital photos ro get poses, include found imagery, distort it and put it in the image
   works with adjustment layers a lot
   before digital you would do lineart, photocopy on coloured paper and work on it with gaouache, marker

first tomb raider was the first crossover to digital
thre was never really an argument about using digital

seys
as a concept artists you can work in costume, vfx, props department, but hes mostly doen art depatment
xombination of normal painting, special brushes (eg leaves) pasted images
scorses production designer
a 3d nodel allows you to move around, find points of views, lighting etc
time wise it takes about the same as doing things analogue, you might be more precise btu perhaps get more life analogue
you can do different color ways, scale pbjects, slide a slider to make something darker etd
captain america
worked from photos of an actul disused cemical factory
trabsformed into hydra prison
hydra language was already established, quite organic forms but also 1939

podium render for ghost in the shell (podium being the engine)
can give you good reflections, lots of broken glass, collage f space

bfg
work with jim clay

caracter costume
worked in costume for rogue one
on big film like star wars you might be working with a dozen other concept artists ni the art departmetn
in costume it's only him ans tw costume designer
even in costume you might draw a whole scene to get a sense for the place
theres a tradition in sw of mixing world war 2 (the new hope www2 flying caps , guns etc, combined with mdoern and historical japanese clothes, unique appraches to tailoring), kit bashing for costumes, you have to go back to clunky shapes

creatures
many people specialise in creature design, do it in zbrush
back in 2001 it was drawugs, maquette, draw over photos of he maquette prduction
mermaids, hal centaurs where there isn't a breal between the two body parts, same skin anayomy etc

vfx work
harry potter soells etc
more technical

props
if the production is smaller the concept artist might get to do a bit f everything
bigger projects have their own concept artist just for the props department
hp stuff
exodus

mezolith comic
stone age dreams and nightmares
10000 years ago when engad was joined to the rest of europe, just before agriculture
ben haggarty
no money in it
good to get back to jst drawing a figure, whereas in film work thre might be a lot of photo bashing, modelling etc
research you look at hunter gatheresrs that still exist today
