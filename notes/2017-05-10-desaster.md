stuied at lcf
ma in fashion business management
ba in fashion photography at lcf

gonna talk about breaking into the industry, free work etc

LCF

- do research beyond ounterest, eg don't look at design for design inspiration to get an outcome that hasn't been done before. also ind out if your specific idea has been done before
- invest time and if you can money into your uni projects, it's really an investment into your own career
- be nice to people
- team up with people that will elevate your work, had 4 porjects to put in her portfolio coming out of uni
- planning is important, if you just go in on the day you may or may not get good results but if you plan you increase the likelihood
- do a lot of shitty work while you're at uni
- Repeat ideas you've worked on in the past, do them better to get development. Eventually you can take inspiration from your own work develop a style
- delegate things - can't compete witha full time retoucher

## portfolio stuff

- select our best most releant work
- focus on the type of work you want to be doing - it#s like a stpre window people will comission you for smilar work (perhaps diff for graphic design)

old woen project
one year project
about how media doesnt let women grow older, plastic surgery, retouching media etc
old + young people retouched together
selected for future map exhibition

lcf pigeons and peacocks magazine
working on clean, hyper controlled style
spent months sourcing furntiure painting it etc

## after uni stuff

hashtag personal branding

- design everything around you eg your website, instagram , emails, invoices, proposals
- send work to media folk - they need stuff to publish, you need eyeballs
- be nice to people (again), keep working with people who show up on time and do the work

## vogue gioiello comission september 2015 (Ruby)

## unpaid work

- evaluate if it's beneficial for your portfolio
- if the answer is yes, do it
- if you do it, do the best you can

- equipment

spreadsheet with prospects, reach out to them again

qs
do you do most of your work in ldn
most yeah, but flies off to milan etc for projects

you were unpaid until you got the vigue comission how did you pay rent
I worked in retail, and did work on personal projects while on that job (that doesn't seem sustainable), work weekends, just do a lot
