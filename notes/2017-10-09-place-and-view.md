A series of work

Placing archive images in different contexts

_Practice-based research_
Find things out through making work (rather than book-reading type research)

a c t i o n and r e f l e c t i o n

Make a piece of work, relfect on it. Reflection is as important is the work itself.

## Intuition about perception

- perception is complete
- perception starts outside
- perception is reactive
- perception is in the present

Turns out all of these are wrong. People used to think that the eyes were the most important (16th century woodcut). In the 19th century people started to think eyes are not good enough to observe complex world

Moshe Bar: Object and Context
Blurry images, people use context, see what they think should be there

- Gorilla ball video
- selective attention skoda ad (cuts to black to mask changes in background. After each cut we construct the scene from scratch, there's no continuous perception)
- 1892 duck/rabbit (you can switch between rabbit and duck, but you can't see both at the same time)
- vase/people in profile
- transparent cube, you can switch from it floating to it sitting on the ground

how you see is influenced by your background, education etc. Seeing is a social, cultural, political act.

- cocktail party effect: You can only really listen to one person at a time.

## Part 1: Paper Folding

- Make to books from newspaper sheets, create random narratives
- Make an A1 sheets from archive images and apply on of the folds

## Part 2: Creating a Visual Narrative

- random
- juxtaposition / contrast
- montage
- repetition
- paralel structures
- erase, remove, hide
- scale up / down
- sequence
- reverse sequence
- circular narrative, loop
- emotional gesture

Parallels between film-making and bookmaking (different cuts, fade to black etc)
