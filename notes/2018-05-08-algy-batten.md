## The art of ping pong, the importance of crap ideas and the value of creative freedom

The Art of Ping Pong is a thing that sells ping pong stuff, puts on events etc

branded christmas cards

started doing tournaments against other agencies
did rundem which is a running thing by nike
slam was gonna be a ping pong tournament in 2012, but nike wasnt into it, so they set up their own tournament

They asked ten artists to do a paddle each would tgen be auctioned off, and donated to charity
this got more media coverage than any of the client work
