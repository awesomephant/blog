abstract: 'The Purple Death is a technologically transmitted epidemic made up from old movie clips, radio announcements and newspaper headlines. Second-hand clichÃ©s and shopworn costumes conspire with stock footage to spread a mass contagion for an age of mass communication.'

Visual trash: The disqualified, that without taste, ot thought of as worthy of serious study.

Buster Crabbe: _Pilot of the 25th Century_, and more importantly _Flash Gordon_ in the 1940s. At that time, people would go to the cinema all the time - so there were all these serialised films.

[Flash Gordon conquers the universe]

These films were made for as little money as possible: Usin stock footage, music from other films, costumes and sets that happened to be lying around the studio. This is the beginning of cut-up cinema. _The purple death_ is the first one in the series. It has this weird, jumbled understanding of technology: Kind of primitive and exoticised, but also mass-media and science fiction.

1944: Captain America The purple death

What is it about purple that these black and white films are obsessed with? For one, purple is the least common colour in nature: This is why it's associated with wealth and power. It's also the first artificial dye. So it's connected to the artificial, unnatural, but also power and wealth.

_Cobra Woman_ (1944)
Maria Montez aka _The Queen of Technicolor_

Jack Smith (1962): The perfect filmic appositeness of Maria Montez

> The vast machinery of a movie company worked overtime to make her vision into seets. They achieeved only inept approximations. but one of the atrocious acing sighs suffused a thousand tons of dead plaster with life

Flaming creatures (1963)

> Juvenile does not equal shameful and trash is the material of creators. It exists whether one approves or not.

- Sontag: _Notes on Camp_
- Newman, Benton (1962): _The New Sentimentality_
- Kenneth Anger (1964): _Scorpio Rising_. Here he basically invents the pop video - editing footage to pop songs of the day. He also didn't like:
- Warhol
- Tom Wolfe (1965): _Pariah Style_
- Warhol (1964): _Empire_. The Empire State Building is from the 1930s - the same time as Maria Montez
- _Horror at Party Beach_ (1964)
- Von Dutch was a hero of 1960s teenage America. In the world of custom cars, pinstriping became a way of hiding seams and whatnot (also made each car different). See also the flying eyeball logo.
- Also: Ed 'Big Daddy' Roth.

> I grew up in darkness, spending most of my time in darkness or with a broken brushful of putrid paind

- Druid Princess (1966)
- Rat Fink (Mickey Mouse turned inside out - the adolescent male made cartoon flesh)

Kids started to wear Nazi memorabilia that their parents had brought back from the war.

Time:

> Dug out of attics and curio shops and freshly minted by the thousandsm the German Iron Cross has become the newsest surfer's emblem and high school fad.
