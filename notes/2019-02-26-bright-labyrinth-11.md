venue: RCA
abstract: 'Japanese monster movies are one example offered by Susan Sontag of what she called ‘the imagination of disaster’. Re-examined in the age of digital SFX and videogame design, what does that imagination reveal to us today? What are the politics of simulation – and how real is ‘real’? Does a digital ecology of networked crowds, landscapes and weather systems exist within the spectacular regime of the green screen? And are we in danger of crashing it completely?'

Godzilla has been around since the 50s. He's grown (in size) but retains an elusive quality.

Sontag: _The Imagination of Disaster_ says essentially that after the second world war a new genre of film emerges from the nuclear threat.

> The film reflect worlwide anxieties and they serve to alleviate them. The inculate a strange apathy ... haunting and depressing

Crossroads film discovers that the US once filmed an atomic Bomb explosion from 60 angles at once. The film edits them all together.

This appetite for disaster in film goes back much further:

The Eidophusikon (1781) is an early (pre-cinema) attempt to bring moving images to audiences.

The Economist Building (1964) in St James Square
Here Alison and Peter Smithson create a kind of cinematic illusion: Three buildings of the same design but at different scales create all kinds of visual effects when you walk around the development. Zooming, enlarging: photographic (_ie_ cinematic) methods.

The Fontainebleau Hotel (The Stairway to Nowhere) by Morris Lapidus (1954). Somewhat of a precursor to post-modernism. Here he puts a massive staircase into the foyer that leads to nowhere. Again, for cinematic effect.

Finally, _Godjira_ (1954). See also [trash culture](/notes/2019/02/05/bright-labyrinth-10.html). The film starts with the _Lucky Dragon No 5 Incident_ (1954), where the American's accidentally dropped fallout onto a Japanese fishing boat (the fish had to be buried).

One of Godzilla's ancestors, of course, is _King Kong_ (1933) with stop motion animation by Willis H O'Brian. Warner re-releases the film in 1954, sparking a huge interested in giant monster films, such as:

Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) with animation by [Harryhausen]().
Meanwhile in Japan: Tomoyuki Tanaka sees the two films above and combines them into _Godjira_ (= Gorilla + _Kujira_, or whale). Special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, who invents the idea of making a monster by putting a man into a costume and filming him in slow motion in a small-scale set. Haruo Nakajima plays Godzilla, Akira Ifukube writes the score.

Early in the film, Godzilla destroys the cinema that the film premiered at.

Two years later, an American buys the rights and completely re-cuts it. The original has this dark, personal story about guilt and loss. That's all cut, instead you get re-shot scenes with Raymond Burr. They also cut all references to the second world war, nuclear disarmament, and the firebombing of Tokyo. This is what happened to most Godzilla films at that time. This is still going on: Power Rangers.

As a result of 9/11, we have this enormous image archive of what urban destruction actually looks like.

By the time we get to _Avengers_ (2012), they're getting very good at showing urban destruction (and it's clear where the details come from). _Pacific Rim_ (2013) also repeats 9/11 imagery.
