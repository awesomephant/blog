Wie Daten und Visual Forensics den Investigativjournalismus veraendern koennen und vice versa

- Investigativ Welt+ Welt am Sonntag
- "Can we make a graphic?": Lacj of coordination between the disciplines, lack of cooperation
- Investigative and data journalism has big overlaps but don't really talk to each other
- Pressure to produce shiny products quickly when really we want to spend more time on things and not chase trends
- Investigative journalists don't use enough data, Data journalists crunch a lot of data but don't really investigate (see election coverage where you send some poorguy out in the country)

Current model is four separate columns: Data/Reportage/Investigation/OSINT (but they should work together)

### Examples

- Adrien (Gilets jauntes investigation): Cooperation between lots of disciplines, and it's not one single story but a big dashboard with lots of information you move between
- [When Lukas F. detonates a bomb, he is 16 years old](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article240001543/Teenage-Terrorists-When-Lukas-F-detonates-a-bomb-he-is-16-years-old.html). (Welt.de)
- [Counting Russia's Dead in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-829ea0ba-5b42-499b-ad40-6990f2c4e5d0)
- [An explosion of culture war laws is changing schoools. Here's how](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/10/18/education-laws-culture-war/) (Washington Post) (building a database from on the ground reporting)
- [FOIA request for Trump judge swatting documents](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/foia-files) (Using FOIA to access non-public data held by public institutions) (EFG-Antrag)
- [A Prison at War: The Convicts Sustaining Putinâ€™s Invasion](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/world/europe/russia-prison-wagner-ukraine.html) (NYT)
- [The Hidden Autopilot Data That Reveals Why Teslas Crash](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/tesla-autopilot/the-hidden-autopilot-data-that-reveals-why-teslas-crash/68D26569-0251-4637-A035-A5131D8883B8) (WSJ) (Very much Forensic Architecture-esque)
