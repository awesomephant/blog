The design system is based on the unit of the acre, traditionally defined as the amount of agricultural land workable by one man in one day. Following this thought, the logotype changes over the course of the year, lying fallow during the winter before growing bolder in the summer.

Design by Oliver Boulton and me, development by me. Logotype developed in Drawbot by Just van Rossum, website built with Wordpress/Timber/ACF. Typeset in Atlas Mono by Carvalho Bernau.
