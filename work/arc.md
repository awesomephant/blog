Website for the online relaunch of ARC Magazine, produced by the writing programme at the Royal College of Art. The editors write:

> ARC: THE DIRTY ISSUE be­gan as a com­mit­ment to grap­pling with the things you may nor­mally retch at — or pre­fer to ig­nore en­tirely. Dirty is that squirm in the back of your brain that keeps you up at night, twist­ing your tongue. Dirty is the pru­dent analysand on the couch drink­ing tea whilst mas­tur­bat­ing over un­re­solved is­sues.

The site is built in [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on Netlify.

It's Set in *Swiss Works* by Ian Party, *Arial Regular* by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunder, and *ARC Regular* (a modified version of *Times*) by William Jacobson.

Art direction by [Maya Guileva](https://mayagulieva.com/) and William Jacobson, design and code by me.
