The site displays artifacts of Caitlin's projects in a loose arrangement that produces the kind of chance encounters and juxtapositions we remembered from our shared archival work at the Royal College of Art.

The site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). It's typeset in [Untitled Sans Regular](https://klim.co.nz/blog/untitled-sans-serif-design-information/) by Kris Sowersby.

Design by Caitlin Kiely and me, development by me. View the live site at **[caitlinkiely.co.uk](https://www.caitlinkiely.co.uk/)**.
