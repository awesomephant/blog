> A repository for words and images produced by Illustration Animation students, staff and researchers at Kingston School of Art.

Design by William Jacobson at Europa and me, development by me. Additional help from Geoffrey Grandfield, Rachel Gannon, and Cicely Pilkington at Kingston.

The site is built on the Wordpress/Timber/ACF stack. Printed editions are generated using Paged.js. Both are typeset in GT Alpina (Reto Moser/Grilli Type), Neue Haas Unica (Toshi Omagari/Monotype) and OS-native emojies.
