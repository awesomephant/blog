The site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with some light [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the display typography. I set up a Google spreadsheet and let everyone on the course fill in their information. Then I exported that into a CSV file, which Jekyll can read out of the box and renders into HTML.

[Untitled Sans](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/) by Kris Sowersby / Klim Type Foundry is used throughout. Art direction by [Xi Cheng](https://chenachenc.com/), design and code by me. View the live site at **[digitaldirection2020.net](http://digitaldirection2020.net/)**.
