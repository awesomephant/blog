My final year at Camberwell College of Arts was focused around the idea of teaching machines to draw. It's something that humans have been doing for a long time, from Gutenberg's printing press in the 14th, Jaquet-Droz's drawing automata in the 18th and Google's DeepDream in the 21st century. I engaged with this history through primary research, building a number of drawing machines using different mechanisms, drawing mediums and control algorithms.

The result is a body of research containing photographs, written notes, Javascript code, physical prototypes and drawings completed by the machine.
