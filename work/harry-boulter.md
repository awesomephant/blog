After working together on [Hot New Graphic Designers in Your Area](https://maxkoehler.com/work/camberwell-2021/) and [Moving Fast](https://maxkoehler.com/work/moving-fast/), Harry approached me to rebuild his personal portfolio site.

The basic design idea is to show a visible grid that reflects the number of images contained in a given project. On the index page we stack all these grids, producing a diagrammatic view of Harry's body of work. In detail views, we use the same grid to show films, titles, meta information, and long-form descriptions of each project. The regularity of the grid and supporting type plays well with Harry's expressive imagery.

The site is built with Composer/Wordpress/Timber/ACF, the typeface is [Canela](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela) by Miguel Reyes, Ilya Ruderman, and Panos Haratzopoulos (Commercial Type).


Design by Harry Boulter and me, development by me. View the site at **[harryboulter.com](https://harryboulter.com/)**.
