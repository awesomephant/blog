intro: An attempt to visually predict the melting of ice using machine learning techniques.
---

After spending several weeks collecting a dataset of melting ice blocks, I was able to train a variant of the [pix2pix](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow) model to generate a prediction of what a given block of ice would look like an hour into the future.

The work was shown as a day-long installation (using a live camera pointed at a block of ice in the exhibition space) at Visual Forensics, a group show held at the London Canal Museum in April 2019.
