*Many people are typing* is a new discussion platform/publication-progress about the environments, social structures, and economies where design is taught and practiced by Kat McGrath, Roland Ross, me, and Julia Schäfer.


Content for the site is produced in a private Slack channel, and automatically published to the website through a custom Slack app and express backend. The front-end is written in React. Design and concept by Ross, McGrath, Schäfer and me, code by me.

[Reckless Light](https://displaay.net/typeface/reckless/) from [Displaay Foundry](https://displaay.net/) and [Aktiv Grotesk](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/aktiv-grotesk) from [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/) are used for display and text.
