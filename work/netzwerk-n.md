Netzwerk N is a non-profit organisation working to advance sustainable development in higher education. It engages with students, academics, professional staff, and political decision-makers and offers a range of events, training programmes, and educational material,.

The new site aims to showcase all of these activites, grow membership, and raise generally raise the organisation's profile. We worked to reduce the amount of energy and bandwidth required to interact with the site by using small, well-optimised illustrations, a single typeface ([Roboto Flex](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Flex/about)), and minimal Javascript.
