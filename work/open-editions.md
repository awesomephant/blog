The site is built on the Wordpress/ACF/Timber stack. The shop is built on standard WooCommerce. It's set in [Diatype](https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/diatype) by Dinamo (Johannes Breyer, Fabian Harb, Elias Hanzer).

Art direction by [David Blamey](https://www.davidblamey.com/), design and development by me. View the live site at **[openeditions.com](https://openeditions.com/)**.
